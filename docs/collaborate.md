# Collaborate on bioSyntax

bioSyntax is a community repository. If you work with a particular file format you'd like syntax highlighting for, develop the syntax files and we'll add them. Don't worry we can help : )

Right now check out the [bioSyntax Repo](https://github.com/ababaian/bioSyntax) and look under 'issues' for development instructions.

If you're really keen, check out the [TODO](https://github.com/ababaian/bioSyntax/issues) for ways to help develop bioSyntax.
